    "Recall that the **imaging equation** for a lens is $1/b+1/g=1/f,$ which corresponds to a system of one focusing lens with focal length $f,$ sandwiched between drift spaces with lengths $b$ and $g$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a beamline description that corresponds to this system, with, for example, $b=3$ m and $g=2$ m.\n",
    "2. Prove that the particles starting with a random angle $x'_0$ and zero position $x$ are focused back to the end of such a system.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Hint:** you can create a random ensample of particles with such properties as\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `X = np.array([np.zeros(n_particles),np.random.randn(n_particles)])`\n",
    "\n",
    "   where `n_particles` is the numbers of particles you want to generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. (Optional) Try to change the position of the quadrupole, i.e. $b$, while keeping fixed the total length of the imaging system (i.e. $b+g=5$ m). Plot both position and angle trajectory for one particle with $x=0$ and $x'_0=1$ mrad for different values of $b$, and show that, with an approriate change of $f$, this particle is always focused back to $x=0$ at the end of system, but what happens to the angle?\n",

    "   **Hint:** for this exercise it is useful to make a small animation with the `interactive` package. "
